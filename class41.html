<h1> positioning of an element</h1>

<h2> The CSS position property is used to set position for an element. it is also

used to place an element behind another and also useful for scripted

animation effect.

You can position an element using the top, bottom, left and right properties.

These properties can be used only after position property is set first. A

position element's computed position property is relative, absolute, fixed or

sticky.

Let's have a look at following CSS positioning:

1. Static

This is a by default position for HTML elements. It always positions

an element according to the normal flow of the page. It is not

affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties.

2. Fixed

The fixed positioning property helps to put the text fixed on the

browser. This fixed test is positioned relative to the browser window,

and doesn't move even you scroll the window.
